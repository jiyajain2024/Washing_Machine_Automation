# Washing Machine Automation Project

This project is an Automatic Washing Machine Control System developed using PIC16F877A microcontroller. 
The system controls wash, rinse and spin cycles automatically and displays the current status on a 16x2 CLCD.

## Features
- Mode and time selection
- Automatic wash, rinse and spin sequence
- Real-time status display on CLCD
- Fully embedded control (no manual switching)

## Components Used
- PIC16F877A microcontroller
- 16x2 CLCD
- Relay module (motor control)
- Water level sensor (if used)
- Switches for user input

## Development Tools
- MPLAB (Embedded C programming)
- Proteus (Simulation, if applicable)

## Working
After selecting the mode, the system starts the washing cycle, followed by rinsing and spinning. 
At each step, the LCD displays the running process. After completion, the final message is displayed.

## Repository Content
The repository contains:
- Source code files
- Header files
- Hex file (optional)
- Project documentation / diagrams (if added)
